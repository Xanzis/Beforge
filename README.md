# Beforge

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge

A simple befunge editor, made when I got tired of using the arrow keys and decided to mess around with the terminal in C. 

## To Run

Compile and run the source. Type ctrl+x to exit edit mode, from there type: e to return to edit mode, s to save, q to quit.

## Other stuff

The window automatically scrolls as the cursor leaves the screen, the characters are stored in a linked list, and arrow keys both move the cursor and change the direction the cursor moves when a new character is typed.
